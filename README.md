### The following methods are implemented:
1. Create a binary tree. The height of the root rectangle is input by the user.
2. Delete a node and its corresponding sub-trees. As input the user has to enter the node number of the tree.
3. Insert a node in the tree. As input the user has to enter the node number of leaf node.
4. Draw all the nodes of the tree as rectangles. This performs a level by level traversal of the tree.
5. Compute the height of the tree.
6. Input a node number from the user and display the rectangle of that node. This is equivalent to searching for a node in the tree.
7. Draw the rectangles contained in only the leaf nodes of the tree.


### Compile using:
g++ main.cpp myconsole.cpp rectangles.cpp mygraphics.cpp -o main.exe -L MinGW\lib -lgdi32
